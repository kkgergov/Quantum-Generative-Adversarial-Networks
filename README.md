# qGAN

This project contains 2 quantum adversarial networks:
1. qGAN that uses state representation, discriminator is regular parameterized circuit
2. qGAN that uses density representation, discriminator is POVM that consists of two elements - E0 and E1,
 which are diagonal. Idea for the code taken from: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab14b5

Further information is in the presentation.
